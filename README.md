# CricDR - AI Cricket Assistant (Built Using Jotform AI Agent Builder)

# Introduction: Idea, Logic, Planning, and Execution

The idea behind CricDR originated from a real-world gap in interactive cricket assistance. While cricket fans, beginners, and even professionals have vast resources online, they often lack a single personalized tool that can quickly respond to cricket-related queries, offer training tips, and assist in analysis. My goal was to create an intelligent assistant that caters to this wide range of users.

The logic was simple: use a no-code AI agent-building platform to train a chatbot-like assistant with comprehensive cricket knowledge. The planning involved gathering relevant data, identifying user needs, designing an intuitive user interface, and training the agent with diverse knowledge sources. The execution phase included training the model using documents, links, and Q&A, designing an interactive frontend, and deploying it across multiple channels such as web, mobile, chatbot, WhatsApp, and more.

In short, CricDR was built to help beginners, professionals, coaches, analysts, and fans with everything from rules to injury predictions—all without writing any code.

# About the Platform: Jotform AI Agent Builder

Jotform's AI Agent Builder is a no-code platform that allows users to create fully functional AI agents for free. It provides a simple user interface where one can upload data, configure responses, and deploy agents across various communication channels.

#What It Offers:

User-friendly drag-and-drop builder

Multi-channel deployment (chatbot, voice, SMS, app, WhatsApp, phone)

Knowledge base training with files, URLs, Q&A, and real-time chat

Built-in tools and widgets (e.g., social follow, display PDF, image selectors)

Seamless publishing with embed codes, QR codes, and direct links

In short, Jotform makes AI accessible to anyone, regardless of technical skills. It handles the backend logic while letting users focus on content and usability.

# Internal Concepts and Working Logic of Jotform AI Agents

Jotform AI agents operate using a layered agent architecture designed to simulate reasoning and respond intelligently. Here's how it works:

# 1. Knowledge Training

Users can provide knowledge using:

Text documents (PDFs, Word files)

Web URLs (Wikipedia, Cricbuzz, etc.)

Q&A Pairs (Manually created question-answer pairs)

Interactive Chat Training (Dynamic learning from conversations)

All inputs are converted into embeddings and stored in a vector database. Jotform then uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to match user queries to the most relevant content.

# 2. Reasoning and Response

Uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to detect intent and context

Combines reactive (direct answers) and deliberative (contextual reasoning) layers

Selects the best response using the knowledge base and semantic search

# 3. Execution Tools

Agents can:

Display PDFs/images

Open external links

Submit forms or gather feedback

Connect to third-party tools using APIs or webhooks

In short, Jotform enables users to build intelligent systems that behave like trained assistants using simple inputs.

# Implementation: Building CricDR Step by Step

# Step 1: Data Collection

Gathered structured data from Kaggle cricket datasets (stats, players, injuries)

Collected unstructured knowledge from:

Wikipedia

ESPNcricinfo

Cricbuzz

ICC, BCCI, Cricket.com

Google search results and images

OpenAI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini)

# Step 2: Knowledge Base Setup

Uploaded PDFs and text summaries of cricket rules, injuries, playing conditions

Added Q&A for rules, player comparisons, match strategies

Trained through chat to refine real-world queries (e.g., "What’s the difference between off-spin and leg-spin?")

# Step 3: Interface and Agent Design

Used Jotform’s form editor to:

Create welcome screen with images and introduction

Design a clean interface for tablet, desktop, and mobile

Integrate tools like:

Social follow buttons

PDF/image display

Website scraper (Find in website)

Image selector for field setup

# Step 4: Feedback and Improvement

Created a form to collect user feedback and suggestions

Used conversation logs to improve question matching and accuracy

Updated training data regularly to reflect current trends and changes in cricket

# Step 5: Deployment

Published the agent as:

Web chatbot

Voice assistant

SMS and phone-based agent

WhatsApp agent

Shared via QR code, embed code, and standalone app link

In short, CricDR was built iteratively using Jotform’s intuitive tools, real-world feedback, and multi-source training data.
